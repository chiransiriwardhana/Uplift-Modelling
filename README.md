# Uplift model for marketing

1. Can we model the uplift (conversion) of customers?

Uplift modeling has applications in marketing because it can forecast how an activity will affect a consumer. In this case, the "impact" can be interpreted as the effect of that action on the user, either beneficial or detrimentally affecting their probability of conversion. Uplift modeling addresses the underlying issue that a client can only take an intervention or not; they are unable to do both. They can only be a part of the treatment group or the control group in a marketing campaign. This implies that it is impossible to quantify a single customer's uplift directly; instead, it can only be inferred from groupings of related customers. In particular, uplift can be defined as the treatment group's customer conversion rate less the control group's customer conversion rate.
